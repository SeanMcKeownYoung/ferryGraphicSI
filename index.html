    The Staten Island Ferry, once regarded as one of the most reliable 
    forms of mass transit in New York City, has fallen into disarray in recent years. 
    The Department of Transportation's inability to recruit and retain qualified crew members 
    during a national maritime workers shortage has resulted in regular service disruptions, 
    particularly during afternoon and overnight hours. The Marine Engineers Beneficial 
    Association, which represents a sizable portion of the Ferry's workforce, has argued that 
    New York City's continued refusal to provide crew members with a “fair and respectful” 
    new contract has contributed to the staffing issues, and subsequently, the service 
    disruptions. </p>

                       In recent years, the Department of

                       The union has been fighting the city for nearly 13 years for a new contract, 
                       with workers not having received a wage increase since 2010 and union officials c
                       laiming the lack of a new contract and existing low wages have made it 
                       more difficult for the city to recruit and retain workers during the 
                       ongoing national maritime workers shortage.</p2>
